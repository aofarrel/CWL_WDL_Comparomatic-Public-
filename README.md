# CWL_WDL_Comparomatic (Public)
Quick and dirty Python solution to compare the output of CWL and WDL runs of the UWGAC Analysis Pipeline. Does not contain any actual logs. Hyper specific to the current version of the CWL and WDL it is comparing. Not applicable for anything else.

As mentioned in the code itself, **this script *recursively* deletes a hidden file exclusive to Mac file systems.** If you are one of the few people who actually care about .DS_Store, don't run this a root directory.
